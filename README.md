# üé≥ Bowling Coach Post Generator

A React web application that helps high school bowling coaches create engaging Facebook posts and tips using AI. The app uses Google's Gemini AI to generate content with a coaching personality tailored to bowling education and team motivation.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Content Generation**: Uses Google Gemini AI to create authentic, engaging posts
- **Multiple Post Types**:
  - Tip of the Day
  - Motivational posts
  - Technique deep dives
  - Team achievements
  - Practice drills
  - Mental game tips
  - Equipment advice
  - Event announcements
  - Season reflections

- **Comprehensive Topic Library**:
  - Fundamentals (Stance, Approach, Release, etc.)
  - Advanced Techniques (Hook Ball, Oil Patterns, etc.)
  - Mental Game (Focus, Pressure, Visualization)
  - Physical Fitness (Stretching, Core Strength, etc.)

  - Skill level targeting (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, All Levels)
  - Custom topics
  - Additional context for personalization

## Security Features

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Safety
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Keep your `.env` file local and never commit it
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Use the `.env.example` file as a template
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Rotate your API key if you suspect it's been compromised
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Share your API key with others
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Commit `.env` files to version control
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Deploy with exposed API keys

**Git Safety Features Included:**
- `.env` is automatically ignored by `.gitignore`
- Pre-commit hook prevents accidental `.env` commits
- Git attributes file provides additional protection
- `git status` will never show `.env` as untracked

### For Production Deployment
If you plan to deploy this app publicly:
1. Set up a backend server to proxy API requests
2. Store API keys on the server side
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Add authentication if needed

### USBC Credentials
The app doesn't require USBC login credentials. It only references publicly available USBC coaching resources via links. You do NOT need to provide any USBC credentials to use this app.

## Technology Stack

- **React 18**: Modern UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Vite**: Fast development and build tool
- **Google Gemini AI**: Content generation
- **CSS3**: Custom styling

## Customization

### Adjusting the Coach Personality
Edit `src/services/coachPersonality.ts` to modify:
- Coaching tone and style
- Expertise areas
- Topic categories
- Post generation guidelines

### Adding New Post Types
1. Add your post type to the `PostType` union in `coachPersonality.ts`
2. The UI will automatically update

### Modifying Topics
Edit the `BOWLING_TOPICS` array in `coachPersonality.ts` to add, remove, or modify topic categories and their items.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized build will be in the `dist/` folder.

## Troubleshooting

### "API Key not found" error
- Make sure you've created a `.env` file (not just `.env.example`)
- Verify the API key is correctly set in `.env`
- Restart the development server after adding the API key

### Generated content is off-topic
- Add more specific context in the "Additional Context" field
- Try selecting a more specific topic
- Adjust the skill level to match your audience

### Copy to clipboard doesn't work
- Make sure you're using HTTPS (required for clipboard API)
- Some browsers may block clipboard access - check browser permissions
